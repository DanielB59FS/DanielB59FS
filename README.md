- ⚠️ **note**:
I highly recommend making contact with a legitimate looking email address, or via Linkedin chat to avoid emails going to spam folder.
Emails reaching my spam folder will most likely not be replied or viewed for security reasons.
Another reason your email might reach my spam folder is if your email lacks context, I will not reply to single line emails such as "I have a business proposition".
